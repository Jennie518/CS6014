Minimum delay for 500-byte packets: 2.4 ms
Minimum delay for 1000-byte packets: 2.8 ms

There minimum delays are likely to represent scenarios where the queuing delay is almost negligible.

Therefore the difference in minimum delays primarily representing the additional transmission delay for extra	500 bytes.

2.8 ms - 2.4 ms = 0.4ms

propagation_delay = minimum_delay_500 - transmission_delay_500 = 2.4 ms - 0.4 ms = 2 ms
 
transmission_delay_1000 = 0.8 ms

queue_delays_1000_estimated = [delay - transmission_delay_1000 - propagation_delay_estimated for delay in delays_1000]

# Calculate the average of these queuing delays
average_queue_delay_1000_estimated = sum(queue_delays_1000_estimated) /len(queue_delays_1000_estimated) =  3.66 ms


#Calculate 600 bytes

transmission_delay_600 = 600/500 * transmission_delay_500 = 0.48 ms
propagation_delay = 2 ms

#Propagation delay is determined by the speed at which the signal travels through the physical medium and the length of the link.
