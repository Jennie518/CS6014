If one of the traceroute delay values between the source and a router hop is unusually high, two possible causes for this unusually high delay might be:

Network Congestion:

If the router or the network link is experiencing heavy traffic, packets may have to wait longer in the queue before being processed. This situation is more common during peak usage times. Network congestion increases the queuing delay, contributing to a higher overall delay.
Increased Processing Time at the Router:

Packets undergo various processing steps when they reach a router, such as IP address lookup, determining the next hop, possible NAT handling, firewall rule processing, etc. If the router is under heavy load or performing resource-intensive tasks, these processing steps may take longer, increasing the processing delay.
While these are two common causes, other factors like changes in the routing path (leading to a longer path) or physical characteristics of the link (like optical fiber damage causing signal attenuation) might also contribute to increased delays. However, network congestion and router processing time are the most frequently encountered reasons in traceroute diagnostics.
